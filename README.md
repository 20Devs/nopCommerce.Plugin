# nopCommerce Complete Plugin
This project contains a plugin for nopCommerce. The plugin was developed by DevExtreme Asp.Net Core components, especially with DataGrid via deep dive into its events on adding or deleting rows.
The plugin's duty is to manage invoice sales. CRUD operations of InvoiceSell and InvoiceSellUnit perform in it. 

I recorded this video to show a demo of how the plugin works.
