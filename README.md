# nopCommerce Complete Plugin
This project contains a plugin for nopCommerce. The plugin was developed by DevExtreme Asp.Net Core components, especially with DataGrid via deep dive into its events on adding or deleting rows.
The plugin's duty is to manage invoice sales. CRUD operations of InvoiceSell and InvoiceSellUnit perform in it. 

I recorded this video to show a demo of how the plugin works.

the techniques that I used to develop the plugin are:

- using client library(Css and Js) in nopCommerce Plugins
- Inject dependencies in nopCommerce Plugins
- Versioning for nopCommerce Plugins
- Using data access in nopCommerce Plugins
- Migrations and Class Mappings in nopCommerce Plugins
- Handling menu items into the administration area from a plugins
- Installing and updating plugins in nopCommerce
- ViewModel Validation in plugins 

nopCommerce is an open source project with interesting design patterns that can be very informative for .NET programmers.This project can be enjoyable for those who have experience with modularizing applications and creating plugins (Modular Monolothic).

As with other projects, some ideas can make changes to improve the performance and development, for example, by adding Domain Centric concepts such as DDD, you can strengthen its domain layer. by preventing bundling and minification during debugging, plugin development could be faster for programmers and reduced costs in the development process.
